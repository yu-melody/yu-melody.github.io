        <p>
            I was born and raised in upstate New York, where I found my sense of self in the same house I still call home. As a kid my interests varied. In elementary school, I spent hours in my backyard crouching next to bricks I'd turn over to examine the insects living underneath. In middle school, I followed instructions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thekingofrandom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-900/90 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline transition-colors">TKOR</a> (rest in peace) to concoct flammable mixtures of sugar and potassium nitrate. In high school, I wrestled with questions of identity as I read deeply and widely, searching for my place in the world.

            Even now as I ease into young adulthood, I bring that same sense of curiosity and drive with me in everything that I do. I'm so grateful for everything and everyone that have influenced my thinking, running, fighting, and resting, and I'm excited to see where this life will take me.
